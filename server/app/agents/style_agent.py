COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AREAS:

1. FORMATTING & STRUCTURE:
- Line length violations and proper line breaking
- Indentation inconsistencies and alignment issues
- Whitespace problems (trailing, excessive, missing)
- Bracket and parentheses placement
- Code block organization and logical grouping

2. NAMING CONVENTIONS:
- Variable, function, class, and constant naming
- Language-specific conventions (PEP8, camelCase, etc.)
- Meaningful and descriptive names
- Consistency across the codebase
- Abbreviation and acronym usage

3. CODE ORGANIZATION:
- Import statement organization and grouping
- Function and class ordering
- Code duplication and repetition
- Logical flow and structure
- Separation of concerns

4. DOCUMENTATION & COMMENTS:
- Missing or inadequate docstrings
- Comment placement and style
- Inline comment quality
- Documentation consistency
- Over-commenting or under-commenting

5. LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
- PEP8 compliance for Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript style guides
- Java coding conventions
- C++ best practices
- Framework-specific patterns

6. MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES:
- Complex expressions that should be simplified
- Magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Long parameter lists
- Deeply nested code structures
- Code that's hard to read or understand

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- Examine the ENTIRE file content, not just diffs
- Look for patterns and consistency issues
- Consider the broader context and codebase conventions
- Provide specific, actionable improvements
- Focus on issues that impact code maintainability and readability
- Be thorough but practical in your recommendations

File: {file_path}
Language: {language}

FULL CODE CONTENT:
```{language}
{file_content}
```

RECENT CHANGES (Git Diff):
```diff
{file_diff}
```

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze the ENTIRE file thoroughly, not just the diff. While paying attention to recent changes, examine the complete codebase for:

1. FORMATTING ISSUES:
   - Line length violations (>80-120 chars depending on language)
   - Inconsistent indentation or mixed tabs/spaces
   - Poor bracket/parentheses alignment
   - Excessive or missing whitespace
   - Improper line breaks in long expressions

2. NAMING CONVENTION VIOLATIONS:
   - Non-descriptive variable names (x, temp, data, etc.)
   - Inconsistent naming patterns within the file
   - Language-specific convention violations
   - Misleading or confusing names
   - Names that don't reflect their purpose

3. CODE ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS:
   - Poorly organized imports (not grouped/sorted)
   - Functions/classes in illogical order
   - Mixed levels of abstraction
   - Code duplication within the file
   - Poor separation of concerns

4. DOCUMENTATION DEFICIENCIES:
   - Missing docstrings for classes/functions
   - Inadequate or unclear comments
   - Inconsistent documentation style
   - Missing type hints (where applicable)
   - Outdated or misleading comments

5. MAINTAINABILITY CONCERNS:
   - Magic numbers without explanation
   - Complex expressions that need simplification
   - Long parameter lists
   - Deeply nested code (>3-4 levels)
   - Hard-to-understand logic flows

6. LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC ISSUES:
   - PEP8 violations (Python)
   - ESLint rule violations (JavaScript/TypeScript)
   - Google/Oracle style guide violations (Java)
   - Framework-specific anti-patterns

For each issue found:
- Provide the exact line number
- Include the problematic code snippet
- Explain WHY it's a problem
- Suggest a specific fix with example code
- Assess the impact on code maintainability

Be thorough and examine every aspect of the code quality, not just surface-level formatting."""
